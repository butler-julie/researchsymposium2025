# University of Mount Union Faculty Research Symposium 2025
Code for Recreating Graphs Shown in the University of Mount Union Faculty Research Symposium 2025. The notebook in this repository recreates the function extrapolation examples that were shown at the beginning and end of the slide show. The slides from the presentation are also in the repository as a PDF file. 

For examples of the SRE applied to physical systems see the code repositories https://github.com/butler-julie/INM-SRE and https://github.com/butler-julie/HEG-SRE.

For a deeper explanation of the development of the SRE method see the papers https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-abstract/161/13/134108/3315000/Accelerating-the-convergence-of-coupled-cluster and https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18234 as well as the thesis https://pa.msu.edu/graduate-program/current-graduate-students/MSU_Thesis__Copy_-2.pdf.
